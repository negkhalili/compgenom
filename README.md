# learning to understand biological data 
I am sharing my journey, trying to learn about coding as a biology learner, these codes are so so simple, basically as my memo notes.


1-basics_codes: This file explains parsing FASTA files, alignment using clustal Omega, and calculating pairwise distance using Jukes-Cantor model

2-rna_seq_basics : read and preprocess RNAseq data, using DEXSeq package to identify differentially spliced exons, visualize Splicing events using rMATS, calculating the PSI value

I would like to continue my journey and add more to the list
